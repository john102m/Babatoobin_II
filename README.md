This is the Umbaraco v13 CI/CD test.  Hosted in GitHub.
Originally this was hosted by Webhosting UK however their shared hosting plan does not allow for setting up a CI/CD pipeline.
So now we host as web app on Azure.  The connection strings can remain unchanged as the original database still resides on WHUK.
